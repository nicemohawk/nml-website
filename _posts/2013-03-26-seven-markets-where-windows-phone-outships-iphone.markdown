Frank X. Shaw, Corporate Vice President of Corporate Communications at Microsoft, posted a [tease](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/03/26/looking-back-and-springing-ahead.aspx) about seven markets where Windows Phone is outshipping the iPhone. John Gruber wants to know [which ones](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/03/26/seven). Here are our best guesses:

- The Tandy 4000 User Group Market
- Dell Phone Support Center, Bangalore, India
- The National Association for the Protection of Squares and Rectangles
- The Collectible Russian Nesting Doll Market
- America Online
- [Keilaniemi, Espoo, Finland](https://maps.google.com/maps?cid=11014744828968295042)
- Bill Gates House Tour Guide Market
