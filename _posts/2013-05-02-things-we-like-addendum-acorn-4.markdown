Gus and Kirstin, over at [Flying Meat](http://flyingmeat.com), just released [**Acorn 4**](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn), which I used to refer to as a “lightweight image editor.” Had it been released a few days earlier, it would have definitely made our recent [Things We Like](/blog/2013/04/things-we-like-april) post. That said, you can't really call Acorn a lightweight editor any more. Straightforward and powerful is more like it.

We use Acorn a lot when developing apps. It's a really great tool for post-processing an asset once we pull it out of a gargantuan mock-up PSD and want to down-sample it, prepare it to be stretchable or create variations on it. It's also really nice for quick repetitive tasks. For instance, we used it a ton for compositing App Store screenshots ([Ita](/ita) has 25 separate screenshot assets[^1] for each supported language[^2]) until we found an app that automatically adds perfect status bars to our screenshots ([Status Magic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/status-magic/id547920381), which we’ll talk about at excruciating length some other time).

Gus has [a nice intro video](http://shapeof.com/archives/2013/4/acorn_4.html) for one of the headlining features, Layer Styles and Filters, which are now completely non-destructive, directly editable on the canvas and super great.

Go get it now — [on sale for $29.99](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/acorn-4-image-editor-for-humans/id634108295) for the month of May. Sweet!
