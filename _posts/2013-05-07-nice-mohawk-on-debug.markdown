We here at Nice Mohawk received a nice invitation to be on a podcastâ€”Debug, hosted by the insouciant and thoughtful [Guy English](http://www.kickingbear.com) and the prolific yet friendly Rene Ritchie of [iMore.com](http://imore.com).  We talk about mohawks, robots, the forthcoming Mac version of Ita, and indie developer life in Ohio.

[Take a listen](http://m.imore.com/debug-14-ben-lachman-and-robert-cantoni-have-nice-mohawk).
