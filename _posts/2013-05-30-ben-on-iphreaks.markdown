### Ben

I recently had the opportunity to guest on another podcast — iPhreaks with Charles, Pete, Rod, Ben & Co. (actually there’s no company, I think that’s all of them). In the show, we talk about prototyping iOS apps and some of the tools available for designers and developers to use in the early stages of defining and building apps. I’ve [spoken on this topic](/talks/prototypes/) a couple times at [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com) but this was a nice opportunity to talk about it in a laid back conversational way. In the second half of the show we also get into some of the thought processes and methodology that can make prototyping cleaner and more effective.

Lastly, I somewhat repeatedly recommend [Briefs 2](http://giveabrief.com) throughout the course of the conversation. Rob and the team over at [MartianCraft](http://martiancraft.com) did a bang up job on it and I can not recommend it enough.

#### &#9997; I really like how this podcast’s show notes are done. Each link is listed along with the time it’s mentioned, which makes it super easy to jump into the show and listen to a snippet about a certain topic or tool that interests you (for instance, the three places we talk about Briefs).
