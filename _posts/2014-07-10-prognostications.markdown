### Bob

1. Android watches show what happens when Google and Samsung don't have a product to copy. 

2. An Apple watch will initially be dismissed as derivative, then its sales will be dismissed because Apple’s a cult.

3. The next version of competitors watches will look and behave a lot like Apple’s.

4. The similarities will be dismissed as obvious, necessary features of wearables that Apple just happened to come up with first.

#### &#9997; Footnote: 5. Tim Cook won’t worry about any of the above.
