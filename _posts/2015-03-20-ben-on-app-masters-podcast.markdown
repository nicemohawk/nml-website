### Ben

A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to have a chat with Steve Young from [AppMasters.co](http://AppMasters.co) and my recent partner in crime (and long time friend), [Joshua Keay](http://joshuakeay.com). Joshua has recently been working from Saigon, Vietnam. Steve is in California and I'm in Ohio. Despite that mix of time zones and internet quality, we had an enjoyable discussion centered around our recent launch of [PhoneExpander](http://PhoneExpander.com). I think the most interesting topic we got to cover was the challenge of making apps that fill a user's *need* instead of simply filling a *want*. This is an interesting concept and kudos to Joshua for unpacking it nicely.  

The Podcast episode is now live. Go give it a listen for youself!
