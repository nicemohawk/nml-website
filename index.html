    <p>Hi, we're Nice Mohawk. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>Ben Lachman and Robert Cantoni started Nice Mohawk in 2012. We create top-shelf apps from the ground up and help people and companies with making good choices related to technology. In 2013, we started a <a href="/blog">blog</a> to talk about things we like (it's sorely out-of-date, but we have all sorts of good intentions of reviving it).</p>
    <p>Sometimes companies hire us to make apps for them or to help them make their products better. If you'd like to talk about working with us, send an email to <a href="mailto:ideas@nicemohawk.com">ideas@nicemohawk.com</a>. Or see what we're up to on Twitter as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/nicemohawk">@nicemohawk</a>.</p>
