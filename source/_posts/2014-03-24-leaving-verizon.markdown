In Novermber of 2012 I decided to leave AT&T and give Verizon a try. I'd been on AT&T since I got my first cellphone and wanted to see if the grass was any greener with the other cellular behemouth. So I signed up myself and my wife with a new Verizon family plan and hoped that things would be better. Better coverage, better call quality, better customer service. I was mistaken. I live in a small college town in southeast Ohio and while LTE covereage was improved, coverage, in general, was about the same as before—dead spots a-plenty once you moved outside of towns and transporation coridors. Call quality, the one thing I was sure would improve, surprisingly took a nose dive. I had more complaints of poor voice quality after moving to Verizon than I ever had on AT&T. But, it wasn't unusable, so I stuck around. I had little need for customer service until recently (we'll get to that), and when I did it seemed hold times were significantly worse but once you reached an agent they were generally pretty good.  

####As an aside, I never realized how much worse CDMA-based network technology is than that of GSM-based networks. Small things like call waiting don't work seemlessly on CDMA, requiring an antiquated ring-back to answer the second incoming call. I was never able to figure out how threeway calling was supposed to work, the option just always seemed disabled. And while knew about the no simultaneous talk + data thing I hadn't considered it meant no calls + tethering—it can be somewhat infuriating when you're working tethered and an incoming call inturrupts a download. Why doesn't anyone discuss these things?
 
Fast forward to a year later, Devember 2013. AT&T has recently annouced their Value Share Plan, seemingly in response to pressure from T-mobile. My business has multiple accounts, both AT&T and Verizon that might benefit from consolidation. Having been somewhat disappointed by the experience on Verizon, I started to think about my options. I hadn't yet upgraded to a iPhone 5s, and hadn't been offered the early upgrade pricing I was used to on AT&T. So switching back to AT&T and purchasing an unlocked 5s seemed like it might be the right choice—and with a no-contract unlocked device I'd have more options in the future. But what about early termination fees? When switching to Verizon, I had paid my ETF and sold my iPhone 4S for significantly more than the ETF had cost me. I figured I might be able to do the same with Verizon. So, to avoid the long hold times I got on Verizon's online chat system. The agent there stated that my ETF "would be around $250". Now if you're remember my account has two lines—mine and my wifes.  I assumed this quote was for closing my account. I assumed wrong. The agent never made an effort to clarify whether I was asking for the ETF for the account or the ETF for closing just the primary line while leaving the secondary line on the family plan by itself.

After running the numbers I realized I could save a significant amount over the course of a 2 year agreement by consolidating my accoutns and switching back to AT&T on their new no-contract plan and buying unlocked devices. There was a significant inital expenditure difference, but overall, the inital savings were around $500 and future years would be even more due to not having to factor in that ETF I had been quoted. So I did it. In January, I switched back to AT&T,  gave my wife my CDMA iPhone 5 (4G only on AT&T), and bought an unlocked 5s for myself. 

####We ended up with a five line plan for just $180/month splitting 4GB of data since most of those lines are not heavy data users. The rest of the lines on the AT&T plan were already out of contract so we didn't need any specific changes there.

This month, life is fine. On AT&T LTE speeds are much improved (often topping 25Mbps vs. Verizon's average of around 8Mbps), no complaints of poor voice quality and I even tethered and talked on the phone while on a recent trip to Chicago. Then take a look at my credit card bill. Verizon has charged me an ETF of $490. Now $490 is not "around $250." So I give Verizon a call. After a long time on hold and no obvious correct choice in the phone support system, I progressively talk to three very nice and completely unhelpful customer service agents. Each one in turn looks at the chat logs, commiserates with my position and says THEY HAVE NO POWER TO CHANGE ANYTHING. Unless. There's always an unless, right? So, they have no power to change anything, unless I come back. If I reactivate my line, all my money will be returned. Everything will be restored. So lets, do that, right? No I say, I've reduced my bill by a significant amount, won't ever have to deal with this kind of crap again and their network sucked. In that case, their agents say, you signed a contract […so we can misrepresent things as much as we want…] and the credit department won't let us refund ETFs. The final agent does have the power to throw me a bone—a $50 courtesy credit.

So I turn to Twitter. First I tweet @VerizonSupport. Ooops. They only handle home phone service and FiOS. So I Tweet @VZWSupport (since that makes sense). I am, after a bit asked to follow them and DM them my account info. After doing so I receive this message:

> Thanks so much for following up! I do show that we issued a courtesy credit of $50.00. The early termination fee's are determined based on the completed months within the contract. The charges would be valid. Have you considered porting back in?

To which I nicely reply that I would be stupid to port back into their network given that they are unwilling to give their *Customer Service* agents the power to correct issues that are well documented. To this, they amazingly bluntly replied:

> We're sorry for the misinfo. We will not be able to issue credits for termination fees as our goal is to get you to stay with us.

At this, I took a moment to boggle. A company that is so wrapped up in itself that it considers its goals of customer retention worth making it a unmovable policy of never making its last impression on a departing customer a good one seems unthinkable. Particuarly in an industry that tracks its "churn." 

####I should note here that when leaving AT&T in 2012, I had a question about my ETF. I called in, spoke with a rep and got a perfectly good answer that left me with a positive feeling toward the company I was leaving. I have no belief that AT&T is a swell company, but slightly more than a year later I'm back with them due to a value comparison and the fact that they didn't do anything too terribly awful in the customer service realm.

I was now mad. For the first time in the whole process I was pissed off. I am a firm believer in treating customers well and, in general, meeting their needs. We do this for our customers and are always willing to issues a refund. But, as a customer I always try to treat agents fairly and politely—I might have let it slip a bit here. I replied: 

> Your only goal is retention, not honesty or customer service? That is terrible. $240 [extra] might be worth it to not be your customer.

And they came back, amusingly with:

> Honesty and customer service is absolutely our business. We can look into a credit if cancellation is restored within 60 days. 

To which I say, that's not customer service or honesty. It's strong-arming me to the tune of $240. Because, if I don't come back to Verizon on contract they're done talking to me. They've given me every courtesey they can offer—$50.

To conclude. I'm calling my credit card to night to dispute that $240 differnce and I'd strongly encourage you to check out AT&T or T-Mobile and their contract free plans. Watch out though if you're a Verizon customer. You can't trust anything they or their agents say unless it's a contract agreement.
